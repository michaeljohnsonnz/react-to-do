# React Todo

This is the classic todo app created in react.js as part of our class. There were some students who were struggling with the setup so I quickly created this barebones project to help.

```bash
# Clone git repository
git clone https://github.com/michaeljohnsonnz/react-to-do.git

# Change into the react-to-do directory
cd react-to-do

# Install the npm modules
npm install

# Start the react server
npm start
```
